# FAIR Data Engineering Project  

This repository is related to the project developed for the **FAIR Data Engineering** course at the University of Twente (UT).  

The goal of the project is to apply FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) into State of Washington's **Electric Vehicle Population Data** dataset, improving its metadata, semantics, and structure.  

Deliverables include the FAIRified and original dataset, the ontology used on the FAIRification, the metadata and Fair Data Point related files.
